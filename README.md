# algebra
Fortran module for basic algebraic operations on arrays.

This basic and simple Fortran module contains some subroutines and functions for basic algebraic operations on higher dimensional arrays.

The module is written mainly in Fortran90/95.

These subroutines evolved during my post-graduate research work in solid mechanics.
